This repo holds the physical design files for the:

     Radiation Tolerant Internal Housekeeping Unit (RT-IHU)

The RT-IHU was conceived as a successor to the Fox-series IHU flight computer.
It aims tp increase reliability in higher Earth orbits where a harsher
radiation environment might cause early failure of the "legacy" IHU design.

The directory hierarchy is as follows:

pcb/<name>              Schematic and layout files for <name> board
kicad_lib               Symbol and footprint libraries for KiCAD
docs                    Design documentation for the supervisor
